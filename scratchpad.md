# Scratchpad of my ideas

I've noticed when working on this project that `npm install` seems to gt everything up and running.

`npm update` seemed to hang for a long time.

When I try and update the _jishi/node-sonos-http-api_ repo seems to be hard locked to an older version.

I managed to version bump by doing `npm install git+https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api.git` in terminal.

This seemed to version bump ok.

## Some things to consder

1. Enable dependabot to version bump and key items or critical issues.
2. Configure codespaces to make easy to install and get going
3. Upgrade and test node-sonos-http-api
